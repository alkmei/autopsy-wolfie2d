# Autopsy

## Run and Build Instructions
This project uses Vite. The only big difference is that game 
assets are stored in the /public folder, rather than the /dist folder.

Rather than starting the live server in VSCode, Vite automatically starts a
live server for you.

Install dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

Run project in dev mode (with auto-reloading). This is probably what you want
if you want to test and grade the project.
```shell
npm run dev
```

Build project for deployment.
```shell
npm run build
```
