        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>
          You play as an undertaker and have to hunt souls that have escaped
          from hell using an arsenal of weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          (80 years ago, a hole thousands of kilometers in diameter opened up in
          the middle of the Pacific. No one knows why it appeared or where it
          leads to. Humans around the world have tried to investigate the
          formation and the interior of the giant window immediately after it
          appeared, but the efforts lead them to nowhere. Life must go on even
          with a giant opening on the planet's surface. At first the world seems
          as it was before. However, 5 days after the first opening, a second
          opening appears, and then a third. Humans quickly realized the world
          they’ve lived for generations has changed into something they don’t
          understand. Those giant openings are like a hole on a prison wall. It
          brought with it countless escaped prisoners from hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through decades of struggle, humans have learned and are still
          learning the ways of fighting against those evil spirits. Although
          civilizations have vanished, terror and struggles remains, but a force
          of resistance has emerged, the Spirit Hunters. )

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>The game will revolve around clearing levels of enemies.</p>
        <p>
          The player can run, jump, and dash. The player also uses an arsenal of
          weapons to fight enemies with. The player starts with a simple long
          ranged weapon. Progressing through levels means the player gains more
          weapons, like a shorter ranged weapon for a tighter level. You will be
          able to move, jump, and dash. You will be able to switch weapons on
          the go depending on your needs.
        </p>
        <h3>Weapons</h3>
        <p>There will be four weapons.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A short ranged scythe</li>
          <li>A long ranged pistol type weapon.</li>
          <li>An explosive grenade type weapon.</li>
          <li>An “ultimate” type weapon, think BFG from DOOM.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Enemies</h3>
        <p>There will be different types of enemies.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A simple fodder-type ghost only capable of contact damage.</li>
          <li>
            A ranged ghost that shoots bullets in the direction of the player.
          </li>
          <li>
            A bulkier, explosion resistant ghost that shoots more bullets at the
            player.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Levels</h3>
        <p>
          The levels will be fairly linear, the goal being to kill all the
          enemies and get to the end of the level. A mixture of linear and enemy
          wave based levels may be viable as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Levels 1, 2, 4, and 5 will introduce new weapons, in the order listed
          above. Levels 3 and 6 will feature bosses. Each level will also
          gradually introduce new enemies.
